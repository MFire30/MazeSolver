# MazeSolver
A graph project for "EDA2" class at Universidade de Bras√≠lia

## About
The ideia behind this assignment is modify the Prim's MST algorithm to generate a perfect maze and modify Dijsktra shortest-path to solve the random maze.

## Known bugs
- Something does not allow the make to look like a perfect maze
- Maze generation is way too slow
